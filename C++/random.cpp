// Write a function called hms_to_secs() that takes three int values—for hours, minutes, and seconds—as arguments, and returns the equivalent time in seconds (type long). Create a program that exercises this function by repeatedly obtaining a time value in hours, minutes, and seconds from the user (format 12:59:59), calling the function, and displaying the value of seconds it returns. 
// Program for addition of two times values given in hh:mm:ss format using friend function
