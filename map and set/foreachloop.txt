using a for each loop (or enhanced for loop) is to simplify the process of iterating over elements in a collection or array when you donâ€™t need to manage indices.

Iterating Over Collections: Perfect for arrays, lists, sets, or other collections where you need to process each item.

Avoiding Index Management: Eliminates the need to manually handle loop counters or indices, focusing directly on elements.

Simplifying Code: Makes your code cleaner and less error-prone by removing boilerplate code related to index handling.

Read-Only Operations: Useful when you just need to read or process elements without modifying the collection itself.
